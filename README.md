# Development

Your new jumpstart project includes basic organization with an organized `assets` folder and a `components` folder. 
If you chose to develop with the router feature, you will also have a `views` folder.

### Serving Your App

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```
